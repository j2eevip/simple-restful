At present, most of my energy is devoted to work, so the company&#39;s year is just like my year.</p><h3 id="about-work" tabindex="-1">About work. <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About work.&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In January 2022, our entire department received a layoff letter and I had to leave an online education company. After two months of job hunting, I received offers from several companies, including some big traditional web2 companies, and of course my current company, okx.</p><p>After failing at an online education company, I learned how to choose a good company, it&#39;s simple, it has to make money or have strong profit expectations.</p><p>So, without much hesitation, I went to okx and refused other offers, even though the salary at okx was not the best.</p><p>After working at okx for a year, I have grown from a dapp beginner to an expert.</p><p>At the end of this year, I received S in the Performance Evaluation, which made me excited all night.</p><h3 id="about-interest-development" tabindex="-1">About Interest Development <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-interest-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About Interest Development&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There is always a special feeling when developing your own projects, and I call this feeling interest development.</p><p>This year, I spend most of my spare time on my blog themes, which help me receive more than 100 stars. It&#39;s really interesting.</p><p>I also submitted PR to some open source projects, mostly to fix bugs. I didn&#39;t intend to submit PR to any project, I don&#39;t like the feeling of intentional work.</p><p>I found that if you want to go deep into an open source project, you have to join the dev team and communicate with them in-depth, otherwise, the code will be submitted haphazardly while wasting your time, but also consuming the maintenance team&#39;s experience to review.</p><p>Apparently, I don&#39;t have much time to participate in the open source community communication at the moment, so everything I do at the moment is a matter of interest, most of them are bug fixes that do not affect the main architecture.</p><p>Maybe someday, when I&#39;m not so busy with work, I can spend more time on open source projects.</p><h3 id="about-life" tabindex="-1">About Life <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-life" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About Life&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This year I went to Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiangsu, Tianjin, and Hebei with my girlfriend. I am happy.</p><h3 id="about-money-management" tabindex="-1">About money management <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-money-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About money management&quot;">​</a></h3><p>My main financial tools this year are bank deposits, money funds, and Bitcoin spots. My investment approach is conservative, but I still get more than 20% returns. Most of them come from Bitcoin. Of course, I&#39;ve liquidated my position now, maybe I&#39;ll buy when Bitcoin goes down again.</p><p>Next year I plan to buy some stocks and ETH spots. Although they will not account for much, because high returns will also assume high risk, my goal is 8% APY, that&#39;s enough for me.</p>',20),s=[i];function r(h,m,c,p,l,d){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
